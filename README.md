# Indian Kids Screentime Analysis

This project analyzes digital screen time behavior and its potential health implications among Indian students. Using both Python for data wrangling and visualization, and Power BI for dashboarding, the analysis reveals trends across age, gender, device usage, and screen time risk levels.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To understand and visualize how Indian children use screens and identify usage patterns that may impact their well-being.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Power BI
- **Dataset**: Simulated data of ~9,700 students including:
  - Age, Gender
  - Average Daily Screen Time
  - Primary Device Used
  - Educational-to-Recreational Ratio
  - Reported Health Impacts
  - Urban/Rural Region

---

## Key Features

### Python ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering:
  - `usage_category`: educational vs recreational balance
  - `health_impact_level`: derived from usage patterns
  - `screen_time_risk`: age-adjusted risk classification
- Exploratory Data Analysis with plots and grouped insights

### Power BI ‚Äì Interactive Dashboard
- Total student count and average screen time
- Screen time trends across:
  - Age groups
  - Device types
  - Risk categories
- Health impact and region-based comparisons
- Interactive filters for gender, age group, and screen time category

## Sample Insights

- Over **81%** of students exceed recommended screen time limits.
- **Smartphones** are the most commonly used device (‚âà47%).
- The **11‚Äì15 age group** has the highest average daily screen time.
- Predominantly **recreational usage** correlates with higher reported health risks (e.g., poor sleep, eye strain).
